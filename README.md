# 1000-rated-rounds-webscraper
This web application is built using Python Scrapy, Node.js, and MongoDB. A PDGA (Professional Disc Golf Association) profile number is put in the input bar, and the 1000 and above rated rounds for that player are scraped from pdga.com/player/*pdga number*/details and displayed on the page.

### Ideas for further functionality for the application:
- Allow multiple numbers to be inputted and display both players' rounds for every event that they both played in
- Use scraping and crawling to get interesting statistics, such as the largest rating point difference between two consecutive rounds in a single tournament among every PDGA member
- Allow users to input numbers of players they want to "follow", and details about each of the players' most recent tournament are displayed
- Scrape data for a given player and output charts and graphs that show the improvement and progression of said player
